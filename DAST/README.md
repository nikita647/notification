## Introduction
This guide explains **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** for Java applications. It covers what DAST is, why it’s important, tools you can use, and best practices to secure your Java apps.

---

## What is DAST?
DAST is a **black-box testing method** that checks for security issues in a running application. It simulates real-world attacks to find vulnerabilities like hackers would. Unlike SAST (which looks at code), DAST tests the app from the outside while it’s running.

---

## Why Use DAST?
DAST is important for Java applications because:
- **Finds Runtime Vulnerabilities**: It identifies issues that only appear when the app is running.
- **Complements SAST**: Works alongside SAST to provide a complete security check.
- **Improves Security**: Helps maintain strong security by catching vulnerabilities early.
- **No Need for Source Code**: It doesn’t require access to the app’s code, making it great for testing third-party apps.

## Popular DAST Tools for Java
Here are some tools you can use for DAST:

| **Tool**          | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Advantages of DAST
- **Real-Time Testing**: Finds vulnerabilities while the app is running.
- **Wide Coverage**: Detects many types of vulnerabilities, including runtime issues.
- **No Code Access Needed**: Works without needing the app’s source code.
- **Helps Meet Compliance**: Ensures apps meet security standards.

## Best Practices
1. **Integrate Early**: Add **DAST** to your CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing.
2. **Combine with SAST**: Use DAST and SAST together for better coverage.
3. **Keep Tools Updated**: Regularly update DAST tools to detect new threats.
4. **Automate Scans**: Automate regular scans to catch issues quickly.

## Conclusion

DAST is an essential tool for securing Java applications. It helps identify vulnerabilities that appear only when the application is running. By using the right DAST tool and following best practices, organizations can improve their security posture. OWASP ZAP is a great open-source choice for detecting security flaws in running applications.
